# introduction to dictionaries exercises Do all of this in a .py file in Pycharm.
# create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs
dictionary = {"one": "d1", "two": "d2", "three": "d3", "four": "d4", "five": "d5"}

# print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
print(dictionary["one"])
value = dictionary["one"]
print(value)
# use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result
print("one" in dictionary)
# use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result
print("three" not in dictionary)
print("six" not in dictionary)
